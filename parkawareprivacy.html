    <h1>ParkAware – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective Date: 01/07/2025</p>

    <p>
        ParkAware (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal
        information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our
        mobile application (“App”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We may collect the following information when you use ParkAware:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong>
            Name, email address, and sign-in credentials (e.g., Sign in with Apple or other supported sign-in methods).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscription &amp; Purchase Information:</strong>
            Details about in-app purchases, subscriptions, free trials, renewal dates, and cancellations you make
            within the App.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Device Information:</strong>
            Device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and crash reports.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Location Data:</strong>
            Only when you grant permission, to enable core features like parking awareness and location-based alerts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>User Content:</strong>
            Any preferences, settings, or optional profile details you provide (such as an avatar image).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. In-App Purchases, Free Trials &amp; Subscriptions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            ParkAware offers optional in-app purchases and subscription plans that provide access to premium features.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some subscriptions may include a free trial period. If you do not cancel before the end of the trial,
            the selected subscription will automatically convert into a paid plan and renew according to the
            billing cycle (e.g., monthly or yearly).
        </li>
        <li>
            Payments and subscription management are handled securely through the platform store
            (such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play). We do not store or process your payment card details.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your purchase history, free trial eligibility, and active subscriptions are linked to your store account
            (for example, your Apple ID or Google Play account) and managed through your store account settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can view, manage, or cancel subscriptions (including free trials) at any time in your
            Apple ID or Google Play account settings, depending on your device/platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deleting the App or your account does not cancel your subscription or free trial—you must manage this
            through your App Store or Google Play account settings to avoid further charges.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Account Deletion</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You may delete your account at any time via the User Settings screen in the App.</li>
        <li>
            When you request deletion:
            <ul>
                <li>Your profile data, preferences, and any locally stored content will be permanently erased.</li>
                <li>
                    Some anonymized analytics data may be retained for reporting and service improvement, but it will
                    no longer be linked to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have an active subscription or free trial, deleting your account does not automatically cancel it.
                    You must cancel through your Apple ID or Google Play account settings to avoid further charges.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
